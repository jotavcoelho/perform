even simpler than useMemo

once again, the reference equality of js is what makes this one important

basically if we have a function on a component and we pass it to a child of said component
react won't realise that it's the same function and will keep using more memory to recreate this function

so it only has one use case
  on functions that we pass to child components
    doesn't matter if it's a "heavy" or whatever
    it's just the act of recreating the same function that makes us useCallback
